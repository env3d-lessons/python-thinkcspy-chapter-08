The following function is simply an example of how to create a new image
using the image library from the text.  Here we create an image
of width and height and set every pixel to red using a nested loop
as outline in chatper 8.11

Here's a video of what this lab will look like when completed:

Exercise 1

Create a image called white_line.gif where the entire image
is black with a single white line across the middle of the image

Exercise 2

Create an image called alternate_lines.gif where we have horizontal lines 
that alternate between black and white

Exercise 3

Using the random.random() function, create an image called random.gif where
each pixel has a 50% chance of being white or black

Exercise 4

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another 
file, message, image, or video. 

The file encoded_image.gif looks normal, but we actually hid a secret black and white
image inside the red channel.  Implement the following algorithm:

 - The secret image is the same width and size of encoded.gif
 - Use our nested loop to process each pixel:
     - If the red channel is odd, turn the resulting pixel on the new image to black
     - if the red channel is even, turn the resulting pixel on the new image to red
